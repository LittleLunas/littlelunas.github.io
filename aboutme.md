subtitle: Why you'd want to leave your child with me
---

My name is Fatime Martinez. I have the following qualities:

- I am passionate about God
- Those I love have my loyalty
- Children are my light

As a provider to your child, know that they will always have an advocate on their side looking for their best interest.  I will work tirelessly to provide the best environment for them to grow. Their safety is my priority, their education is my gift, and their developement is my mission. 

### My History

I have been a self contained provider for over a year now. But my experience does not stop there.My first experience raising children began when I was a child myself. As the oldest daughter, I was charged with the care of my younger siblings from their birth. Around this time, I would often care for another family member with special needs.  Not long after, I was placed in a postion where the care of my older brother became a priority when he became increasingly ill. Eventually I would work as a provider under another self contained location for tolders. And finally, the most precious gift was delivered to me when I was given the oppertunity to care for my own child. As you can see, providing care is my life. It is something that I love doing. Your child will know love, joy, song, dance, letters and number, manners, ettiquette, and potty time. Whatever the need, I can provide it, because that is what I was meant to do.

My love and regards,

Fatime Martinez
